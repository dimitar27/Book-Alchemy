- Sort books by title or author name
- View book covers using ISBN (via Open Library)
- Delete books and remove orphaned authors

## Tech Stack

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dimitar27/Book-Alchemy.git
   cd Book-Alchemy
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è First-Time Setup Note

Before running the app for the first time, **uncomment** the following lines in `app.py` to create the database tables:

```python
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

Once the tables are created, you can comment those lines out again to avoid reinitializing the database every time the app runs.

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5001
   ```
